Based on https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate

## Quick start

1. Make sure that you have Node.js v10 and npm v6 or above installed.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.
1. `Light` and `Dark` buttons are to change theme color.
1. The table is initially empty. Click `Fetch` to get some rows to display; you can fetch again to get different rows.

## Future works

1. Replace using component type and props for customizing Pagination by using render function
1. Extract sorting functionality to independent class
1. Use clsx instead of manually chaining css classes
